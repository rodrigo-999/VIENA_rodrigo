This is the firmware that is to be compiled and uploaded into the BMS master unit

It is important to know that the .zip file in this folder only contains the embeded software folder (github did not allow to upload the all the files)
However the only files changed durring this thesis work are the ones contained in this folder
If you intend to compile and upload this code, please download the foxBMS firmware from https://github.com/foxBMS/foxbms-1 and replace the embeded software folder for the one in this repository
