In order for the foxbms.py code to run when the rpi is turned-on the launcher.sh file is necesserry. Futhermore the steps bellow are also required


STEPS:
1) on the RPI terminal type "chmod 755 launcher.sh" to make launcher.sh executalble

2) on the RPI terminal type "sudo crontab -e"
3) add the flowing command to the end of the file

@reboot sleep 70 && sh /home/pi/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1


-this command will run the code in file /home/pi/launcher.sh every time the RPI turns on
-it will not run at start up but rather 70 seconds after the RPI turns on
-this delay is to allow the RPI to boot and connect to a network
-any errors or logs will be recorder in a text file /home/pi/logs/cronlog

Notes:
acording to this code and commands the laucher.sh must be inside "/home/pi" and the foxbms.py file must be inside "/home/pi/foxbms_Can/"
in the laucher.sh file it is important that PYTHONPATH points to the place where the CAN python lybrary is stored
